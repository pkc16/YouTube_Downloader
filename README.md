# YouTube_Downloader
Python3 application to download video from YouTube (or download audio portion only from video).

I created this application because I was wary of downloading and installing executable files from sites which offer YouTube downloaders.  Even though some are free, one doesn't know exactly what those programs are really doing.

The settings inside of the config file (yt_downloader_config.txt) should be modified to the user's environment.

#### Usage
Enter in the URL of a YouTube video.  Then specify the desired type of output; either video (which includes audio) or just audio only.

#### External Libraries used
- tkinter
- pytube
